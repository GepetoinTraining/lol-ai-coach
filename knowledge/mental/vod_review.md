# VOD Review Methodology

## The 3-Game Training Block

To avoid cognitive exhaustion and "autopilot" mode, structure practice in **3-game high-intensity sessions**.

### Why 3 Games?
- Human brain maintains maximum focus for limited periods
- After 3 matches, take an extended break (1+ hour)
- Use break time to review data or VODs before returning

### Session Structure:
```
[Game 1] → [Game 2] → [Game 3] → [1hr+ Break + Review] → [Repeat]
```

## VOD Review Process

Effective review focuses on finding the **root cause of errors**.

### Step 1: Identification
Locate the moment where a core principle was violated.
- Example: Failed tethering that led to a death

### Step 2: Isolation
Dedicate the next games to focusing **exclusively** on correcting that specific variable.
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Pick ONE thing per session

### Step 3: Reinforcement
Apply mental feedback for each mistake.
- Example: Verbally note each missed CS
- Creates conscious awareness of the fundamental

## What to Look For

### Laning Phase (0-14 min):
- [ ] Early deaths - what caused them?
- [ ] CS missed - was it trading, spacing, or mechanics?
- [ ] Wave state before deaths - were you overextended?
- [ ] Ward usage - did you have vision when you died?

### Mid Game (14-25 min):
- [ ] Objective timing - were you there?
- [ ] Death locations - lane vs jungle vs objective pit
- [ ] Farm maintenance - did CS/min drop?

### Late Game (25+ min):
- [ ] Teamfight positioning - frontline or backline mistakes?
- [ ] Death timing - before or after objective?
- [ ] Item completion - optimal build path?

## Common Review Mistakes

1. **Watching at 1x speed** - Use 0.25x for key moments, 2x for downtime
2. **Blaming teammates** - Focus only on YOUR decisions
3. **No note-taking** - Write down patterns you notice
4. **Too many focus points** - One thing at a time
5. **Only reviewing losses** - Wins have lessons too
