# Wave Management Fundamentals

## The Law of Troop Balance: The 4 Minion Rule

To maintain a permanent **Freeze** near your tower, the enemy wave must have a numerical advantage to compensate for your reinforcements arriving faster.

### Key Rules:
- In side lanes, you need **4 extra enemy caster minions** in the wave
- Maintaining the freeze requires "trimming" the enemy wave to prevent it from becoming too large for the tower

## The Return Time Law: The Cheater Recall

The **Cheater Recall** is a manipulation technique that allows a base return for item purchases without losing experience or gold.

### Execution:
1. **Wave 1-2**: Push slowly (Slow Push)
2. **Wave 3** (cannon wave): Push aggressively into enemy tower
3. **Recall window**: Return to base while opponent clears minions

### Timing:
- Execute around 2:30-3:00 game time
- Returns you to lane with item advantage before wave bounces back

## Lane State Recognition

| State | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Slow Push** | 1-2 extra minions, builds over 2-3 waves | Setting up dives, cheater recall, roam timing |
| **Fast Push** | Killing all minions ASAP | After kills, objective plays, base timing |
| **Freeze** | Holding wave outside tower range | When ahead, denying farm, safe farming |
| **Reset** | Crashing wave into tower | Neutral lane state, after trades |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-pushing without vision** - Creates gank vulnerability
2. **Breaking freeze too early** - Loses XP/gold advantage
3. **Not trimming during freeze** - Wave crashes into tower
4. **Slow pushing into a losing matchup** - Gets zoned off wave
