# Macro Fundamentals

## Objective Priority and Timing

### Objective Value Hierarchy:
1. **Nexus** (game-winning)
2. **Baron/Elder Dragon** (game-changing)
3. **Inhibitor** (pressure)
4. **Dragon Stacks** (scaling)
5. **Rift Herald** (tempo)
6. **Towers** (gold + map control)

### Key Timing Windows:
| Objective | Spawn Time | Respawn | Power Spike |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Rift Herald | 8:00 | N/A (2nd at 14:00) | 1st tower plates |
| Dragon | 5:00 | 5:00 | 4th stack = Soul |
| Baron | 20:00 | 6:00 | Late game push |
| Elder | 6:00 after soul or 35:00 | 6:00 | Win condition |

## Rotation Fundamentals

### When to Rotate:
- After pushing wave into tower
- When your jungle is on the same side
- When objective is spawning
- After a kill in lane

### When NOT to Rotate:
- Large wave crashing into your tower
- No vision of enemies
- Key cooldowns are down
- Objective isn't spawning soon

## Macro Decision Tree

```
After winning a fight:
├── 3+ enemies dead?
│   ├── 50+ seconds death timer? → Baron or Elder
│   ├── Baron/Elder up? → Take it
│   └── No? → Push for inhibitor
├── 2 enemies dead?
│   ├── Objective up? → Take it
│   └── No objective? → Push towers
└── 1 enemy dead?
    └── Push wave and reset / take camps
```

## Common Macro Mistakes

1. **ARAMing mid** - Side lane pressure wins games
2. **Chasing kills over objectives** - 3 kills don't equal Baron
3. **No setup before objectives** - Vision + wave management
4. **Fighting without win condition** - Know your comp's spike
5. **Split push without TP** - Creates 4v5 situations
